        <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
        <p>
          SkiGeek is a newly founded company, founded in 2022 by Edward
          Fagerström. SkiGeek is a ski gear reseller, working together with big
          companies such as The Faction Collective and Sweet Protection. Despite
          being a fairly new company, we have gained fast success and are
          growing at a pretty much exponential rate. The secret behind the
          success has been the bussiness concept: Selling gear at an affordable
          price. By mounting your own bindings to your skis instead of having a
          retailer do it for you we are able to charge you a lot less, meaning
          you save money. Easier for us, more money for you, it's a win-win
          situation! By not buying premounted binding, you also gain the freedom
          of choosing the binding that suits best which gives you an even better
          experience out on the snow.

          Since SkiGeek is a reseller, we rely on production from the companies
          we collaborate with. This means that the products we sell are produced
          in The Faction Collectives and Sweet Protections factories. The
          Faction Collective produces their products in Verbier, Switzerland
          while Sweet Protection has their factory located in Østerdalen,
          Norway.
